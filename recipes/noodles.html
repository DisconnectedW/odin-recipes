    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles, reserving seasoning packets, in boiling water until softened, about 3 minutes. Drain noodles and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a small skillet. Cook and stir beaten eggs in hot oil until scrambled and firm. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add green onions into hot oil and stir fry until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove green onions to a plate; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in the same wok or skillet over medium heat. Add carrots, peas, and bell pepper separately; stir frying until softened, removing each to the plate with green onions when done.</li>
        <li>Combine 2 tablespoons sesame oil with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the same skillet or a wok over medium heat. Stir fry cooked noodles in hot sesame-vegetable oil, tossing frequently, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with desired amounts of sesame oil, soy sauce, and reserved ramen seasoning packets; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Stir in cooked vegetables, tossing frequently, until heated through, about 5 more minutes.</li>
